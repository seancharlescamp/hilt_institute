I've been a math, computer science, and information technology teacher for
more than twenty years. I've always loved to learn new things, and I feel very
lucky to be working in a job that centers around investigating new ideas,
learning, and growing as rich human beings. Even after 22 years, I can't wait
for each new year to start in August, so I'd like to pass on to everyone one of
my favorite quotes from Confucius: "Find a job you love and you'll never work
a day in your life." I'm having so much fun this year teaching Math Foundations
and Pre-algebra and Intro to IT in the HILT Institute. We are working hard to
get ready for Mr.  Zawolo's Algebra class next year. I'm also working with
students from the HILT Institute in our Advanced Topics in IT class to make the
web site for the HILT Institute. The HILT Institute is a great program, and I'm
very happy to be here!

Mr. Isaac S. Zawolo, Jr. was born in Monrovia, Liberia. He received his
education in Liberia, the Ukraine (former USSR) and the United States of
America. Mr. Zawolo joined the Arlington Career Center in 2004. He is a hard
working teacher who believes in raising the bar and maintaining very high
academic standards. It was in recognition of these qualities and his commitment
to the education of children in the United States of America that he was named
as Teacher of the Year for 2009-2010 of the Arlington Career Center. By
training, Mr. Zawolo is an engineer and an educator. He has however chosen to
remain in the area of education since 1997. He attributes his choice of the
education profession to his upbringing on the campus of Kakata Rural Teacher
Training Institute, KRTTI, where his father worked for many years as a trainer
of teachers and his lifelong desire to emulate the example of his father.  As a
child while growing up on the campus of KRTTI, the young “Isaac” would organize
“play schools”. This led to an appreciation for the education profession and
though he endeavored so hard to fulfill his father’s dream to see him become an
engineer his heart and soul remained in education. Mr. Zawolo is married  and
is the  father of four children, Izetta, Isaac III, Esinia, Fidel and two
grandchildren, Blessing Gray and Gisele Zawolo. His son, Isaac III is a member
of the United States Air Force.
